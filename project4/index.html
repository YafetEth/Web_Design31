            <h2>Impact of Climate Change</h2>
                <p>Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earths local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term.

                Changes observed in Earths climate since the mid-20th century are driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earths atmosphere, raising Earths average surface temperature. Natural processes, which have been overwhelmed by human activities, can also contribute to climate change, including internal variability (e.g., cyclical ocean patterns like El Niño, La Niña and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings (e.g., volcanic activity, changes in the Suns energy output, variations in Earths orbit).
                
                Scientists use observations from the ground, air, and space, along with computer models, to monitor and study past, present, and future climate change. Climate data records provide evidence of climate change key indicators, such as global land and ocean temperature increases; rising sea levels; ice loss at Earth’s poles and in mountain glaciers; frequency and severity changes in extreme weather such as hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, floods, and precipitation; and cloud and vegetation cover changes..</p>

            <h2>Causes of Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Fossil fuels coal, oil and gas are by far the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 per cent of all carbon dioxide emissions.
                As greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the suns heat. This leads to global warming and climate change. The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history. Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns and disrupting the usual balance of nature. This poses many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth./p>

            <h2>Solutions to Climate Change</h2>
            <p>The single-most important thing that we can do to combat climate change is to drastically reduce our consumption of fossil fuels. The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas in our buildings, industrial processes, and transportation is responsible for the vast majority of emissions that are warming the planet—more than 75 percent. In addition to altering the climate, dirty energy also comes with unacceptable ecological and human health impacts.</p>

            <h2>Take Action for Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Individuals can make a difference by taking actions such as.
Save energy at home. ...
Change your home's source of energy. ...
Walk, bike or take public transport. ...
Switch to an electric vehicle. ...
Consider your travel. ...
Reduce, reuse, repair and recycle. ...
Eat more vegetables. ...
Throw away less food.
