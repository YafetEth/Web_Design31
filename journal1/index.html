            <h2>What is a website anyway?</h2>
            <p>To me a website is something we need in our everydaylife and we rely on it everyday. Yes by defention It serves as a platform to share information, interact with users, and showcase various types of content.
                But even with the rise of soical media i believe we need websites now more than ever. Webistes do things that instagram and these other social media sites cant do, we can have full ceative control and not to mention ownership.

            <h2>Why put things on the internet?</h2>
            <p>By Putting things on the internet we allow for the sharing of information to inform and educate others. It also enables us to communicate with people from around the world.</p>

        <!-- Bulletin 3 -->
        <div class="bulletin">
            <h2>Will websites someday become obsolete?</h2>
            <p>As mentioned in the Schwulst article social media has overtaken webostes, but While technology continues to evolve, websites can have a niche in the market. Websites  will remain a valubale part of the digital landscape, serving as a primary means of online communication and information sharing.</p>
