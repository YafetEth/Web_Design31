            <h2>Are you satisfied  with the work you produced?</h2>
            <p>I would say im satisfied  with the work i have produced in this class considering the fact i had little exprience with coding.</p>

            <h2>How the web design skills we've covered may or may not help further your growth as a creative person.</h2>
            <p>Coding in this day and age is something thats valubale whether its my major or not, its just something valubale to have as a skill even if it has nothing to do with my job. Also a lot of online jobs and side jobs all incude online coding. </p>

            <h2>Has the class changed your views on art, technology or visual culture?</h2>
            <p>It definitely  has changed my views on visual culture, by designing a webpage to satisfy a certain audience and using trends that are popular to create the design of my website. This whole semester I was able to use what I love whether that was books, certain genre of music or even video games too create my webpage. These pages were my representation of a visual culture and my views on art. .</p>

        <div class="bulletin">
          <h2>Do you plan on using your skills in the future? Really, it's ok if you never plan on coding another website ever again but tell me more and be honest!</h2>
          <p>I don't know if I will ever use the things I learned in class to code a website but its certainly not out of the question. I may need not create a website for a business I want to create one day so its defiantly something I may use in the future. .</p>
      </div>

      <div class="bulletin">
        <h2>Any closing remarks for the rest of the class?</h2>
        <p>It was great seeing everyones vision and what they love and how they were able to communicate that via their webpages. Everyone including me had their own unique way of showing us what they want to tell us even tho we all had the same standards. Overall it was a fun and educational class, I had some fear not ever coding before other than one summer class but I was happy I signed up for it..</p>
