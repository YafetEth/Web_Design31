        <h1>The Road Not Taken </h1>
        <h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
            

        <!--first stanza-->
        <div>
        <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</p>
        <P>And sorry I could not travel both</P>
        <P>And be one traveler, long I stood</P>
        <P> And looked down one as far as I could</P>   
        <P>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</P>
        </div>

        <!--second stanza-->
    
        <div class="second">
        <P>Then took the other, as just as fair,</P>
        <P>And having perhaps the better claim,</p>
        <P>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</P>
        <P>Though as for that the passing there</P>
        <P>Had worn them really about the same,</P>
        </div>
        

        <!--third stanza-->
        <section>
        <div class="third">
         <P>And both that morning equally lay</P>
         <P>In leaves no step had trodden black.</P>
        <P>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</P>
         <P>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</P>
         <P>I doubted if I should ever come back.</P>
        </div>
    </section>

        <!--fourth stanza-->
        <section>
        <div class="fourth">
        <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh</P>
        <P>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</P>
        <P>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-‚Äù</P>
        <P>I took the one less traveled by,</P>
        <P>And that has made all the difference.</P>
        </div>
        </section>
