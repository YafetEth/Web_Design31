                <h2>Article Reflection</h2>
                <p>The article talks about "responsive design" for websites and discusses the difficulties in making sites that adjust to various screen sizes. Chimero stressâ€™s the need to stick to the natural features of the web when designing and warn against creating sites that don't follow these principles. The metaphor "bicycle bear websites" is used to describe impressive but impractical sites that don't go well with the nature of the web and don't offer a good user experience. 
                    This article very much relates to the work we are doing in our class because we are learning about media queries and and screen responsiveness and how what we write in our Html and Css codes affect how users experience our webpages on different devices. Its a delicate balance of acknowledging the challenges that come with making websites adaptable to different devices and finding solutions that go well with the fundamental nature of the web.</p>
